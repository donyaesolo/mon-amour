          <p>So today, I met this kid named Zach. He seemed really cool, Fen didn't really like him due to the first impression that he gave off
          but eventually he figured out the puzzle and was allowed into the server. At first I was just going to be the really savve Admin that
          would help him. I found it cute that he took a lot of the things I said quite literally. And then after having a long talk in the mental
          health chat, we went to bed. This kid and I had a lot in common when it came to our problems. I really want to help this kid with his
          problems.<br />

          <p>So, today Zach and I talked more about his problems and then I brought Kat in to help with the relationship advice because I'm not quite
            sure if I was best person to talk to about with this stuff. I think the night prior I was kinda interested in him but bushed it off. I found
            joking around with him funnier because he took things very literally. We started talkin some more random shit and then I was hey yo lemme me voice
            chat with ya. And we did for hours. During that voice chat, things got very sexual. Up until this point, I was hesitant in engaging in romantic
            relations with a 15 year old. But the more talked with him the more I wanted to be with him. We were up all night, doing some kinky shit. Having a
            shit ton of fun. Until I fell asleep around 7 am.<br />

          <p>Today Zach and I continued with our sexual adventrues like horny teenagers who just discovered their private parts. I'm not saying that I'm not
            enjoying it because I am. I asked Zach to be my boyfriend, he said yes which made me extremely happy. I really hope that this will work out, there
            are going to be challenges such as college and how we are going to handle the different environments. I hope I get to into a college near Zach, that would
            make seeing him a lot easier. I really fucking miss him sometimes that it hurts, I wonder if that happens to him. I can really start seeing him in my
            future. I really want him to be in my future. So I hope to god that we work out. He is ony of the best things that has ever happened to me. I wante
            him one day to see how amazing he actually is. Because he is such an amazing person and I really find myself falling in love with him. I think he
            would make an amazing husband and father one day. <br />

          <h1 id = "title"> Day 4 </h1>
          <p>Today Zach and I talked about our future. Talk about how many kids we wanted. We agreed on at least 2 kids, the name is going to be Zeus if it was
            a boy or Zuri if it was a girl. We kept with the first names starting with a Z because I was hard about keeping my last name. I am so fucking happy with
            Zach. I can't stop fucking smiling with him, he brings me so much joy it's hard to contain. God, I love him so fucking much. I don't want to let him go. I
            don't want to see him go. I plan on being his wife and the mother of his children. <br />

          <h1 id = "title"> Day 5 </h1>
          <p>Today was a chiller day considering that I told Zach that he can't masturbate so his sperm can regenerate. Kind of drained him dry, whoops. We had a more serious
            talk today about him. Honestly I don't feel like I am really good at picking up his mood. He feels like I can help but I don't know how to help, it makes my
            efforts fruitless. But he tells me that my efforts are in vain. So I will continue my darn hardest and the day I figure out what helps with be an amazing day.
            We defined some more boundries today. Like what I can and can't do so I don't leave it up to the imagination. I think that I get too sensative to things, Zach
            said some things that I that rubbed me the wrong way. Did I tell Kat? Yes. Did I tell Zach? No. Kat had to tell him while I cried like a fucking pussy. Why can't
            I just fucking tell him that shit. And even then I had to show him screenshots when I did tell him and with my own words. I have to grow up man. I have to be
            a good partner and a good partner has good communication. If I can't communicate what I am feeling because I don't like confronting people, then I don't deserve
            to be his partner.<br />

          <h1 id = "title"> Day 6 </h1>
          <p>Today I think was a good and bad day. We had a pretty relaxing day, he was asleep for most of it.(5pm). And I got to listen to a conversation being him and Jim
            Jammelson which was entertaining. They are extremely loud when in the same conversation but it can be entertaining. After that we went on our own and had our own
            conversation. It was all good until I was being disobediant. I wasn't listening to what he was telling me to do and I was being cringy. When he explaining what I
            was doing wrong, I couldn't look at the camera. I felt ashamed and sad that I couldn't bring myself. He said how much he had a distane for silence until he wanted it.
            I continued to be quiet, I was hearing what he was saying, the more I didn't talk the more I felt like a bad partner. Maybe I am not a good partner, I mean I couldn't
            do simple task. I want to be a good partner but what if I keep messing up. What if I'm not what he looking for, what if I don't learn to be better even if I'm trying.
            What if that's not good enough. I don't want to loose him. What if all my mistakes make him not love me anymore. I wake up and I get a message saying that he doesn't
            love me anymore, that all of my mistakes made him loose intereste, give up on trying to help me better. I want to be a good partner... <br />
