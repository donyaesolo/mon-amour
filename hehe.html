        <p>So today, I met this kid named Zach. He seemed really cool, Fen didn't really like him due to the first impression that he gave off
        but eventually he figured out the puzzle and was allowed into the server. At first I was just going to be the really savve Admin that
        would help him. I found it cute that he took a lot of the things I said quite literally. And then after having a long talk in the mental
        health chat, we went to bed. This kid and I had a lot in common when it came to our problems. I really want to help this kid with his
        problems.<br />

        <p>So, today Zach and I talked more about his problem and then I brought Kat in to help with the relationship advice because I'm not quite
          sure if I was best person to talk to about with this stuff. I think the night prior I was kinda interested in him but bushed it off. I found
          joking around with him funnier because he took things very literally. We started talkin some more random shit and then I was hey yo lemme me voice
          chat with ya. And we did for hours. During that voice chat, things got very sexual. Up until this point, I was hesitant in engaging in romantic
          relations with a 15 year old. But the more talked with him the more I wanted to be with him. We were up all night, doing some kinky shit. Having a
          shit ton of fun. Until I fell asleep around 7 am.<br />

        <p>Today Zach and I continued with our sexual adventrues like horny teenagers who just discovered their private parts. I'm not saying that I'm not
          enjoying it because I am. I asked Zach to be my boyfriend, he said yes which made me extremely happy. I really hope that this will work out, there
          are going to be challenges such as college and how we are going to handle the different environments. I hope I get to into a college near Zach, that would
          make seeing him a lot easier. I really fucking miss him sometimes that it hurts, I wonder if that happens to him. I can really start seeing him in my
          future. I really want him to be in my future. So I hope to god that we work out. He is ony of the best things that has ever happened to me. I wante
          him one day to see how amazing he actually is. Because he is such an amazing person and I really find myself falling in love with him. I think he
          would make an amazing husband and father one day. <br />
